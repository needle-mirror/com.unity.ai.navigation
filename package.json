(Requires Unity 6000.0.22f1 or newer)\n* The AI Navigation overlay was rarely needed upon the initial installation of the package. Now it is hidden by default and you can enable it through the [Overlay Menu](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/display-and-hide-overlay.html).\n* Fixed a regression that caused the Editor to allocate unnecessary memory on some platforms, when the project contained package test files."
