# NavMesh Surface component reference

Use the NavMesh Surface component to define and build a [NavMesh](./Glossary.md#NavMesh) for a specific type of [NavMesh Agent](./NavMeshAgent.md) in your scene. Use the available properties to specify the type of NavMesh Agent that can use the NavMesh, the area type to assign to the generated NavMesh, and the geometry to use when you bake the NavMesh.

To use the **NavMesh Surface** component, apply it to the [GameObject](./Glossary.md#gameobject) on which you want to build the NavMesh.

To apply the NavMesh Surface component to a GameObject, do the following:

1. Select the GameObject.
2. In the Inspector, select **Add Component** &gt; **Navigation** &gt; **NavMesh Surface**. <br/> The Inspector window displays the NavMesh Surface component.

In the NavMesh Surface component, you can click **Bake** to generate the NavMesh for the current settings and scene geometry. The resulting [NavMesh data](./NavMeshSurface.md#navmesh-surface-asset-file) replaces any NavMesh that **NavMesh Surface** already contains, if that is the case.
 A [**Scene**](./Glossary.md#scene) can contain multiple NavMesh surfaces. You can add the NavMesh Surface component to any GameObject in your scene. This is useful for when you want to use the GameObject parenting [hierarchy][1] to define which GameObjects contribute to the NavMesh. Only the NavMesh Surface components that are enabled and part of active GameObjects load their NavMesh data into the navigation system. You can unload NavMesh data from the scene by disabling either the **NavMesh Surface** that contains it or the GameObject that the NavMesh Surface is attached to.

The following table describes the properties available in the NavMesh Surface component. Use the main settings for the NavMesh Surface component to filter the input geometry on a broad scale. Use the [NavMesh Modifier](./NavMeshModifier.md) component to adjust how Unity treats input geometry on a per-GameObject basis.

Use the Object Collection settings to define which GameObjects to use when you bake the NavMesh.

Furthermore, you can use the [NavMesh Modifier](./NavMeshModifier.md) component to designate more precisely the objects, and their hierarchies, that the NavMesh Surface can or cannot collect.

## Advanced Settings

Use the Advanced settings section to customize the following additional properties:

| **Property**            | **Description**      |
|:------------------------|:---------------------|
| **Override Voxel Size** | Control how accurately Unity processes the input geometry when you bake the NavMesh. This is a trade-off between speed and accuracy. <br/> The default size is one third of the Agent [radius](./NavigationWindow.md#agents-tab), which translates into 3 [voxels](./NavInnerWorkings.md#about-voxels) per Agent radius. This voxel size allows the capture of narrow passages, such as doors, and maintains a quick baking time. For big open areas, you can use 1 or 2 voxels per radius to speed up baking. Tight indoor spots are better suited to smaller voxels, for example 4 to 6 voxels per radius. More than 8 voxels per radius doesn't usually provide much additional benefit. <br/> To change the default size, select this checkbox. In the **Voxel Size** field, specify the size of the voxels to use when you bake the NavMesh. |
| **Voxel Size**         | Specify the size, in world units, of the voxels to use when you bake the NavMesh. This property is only available if you select the **Override Voxel Size** option.|
| **Override Tile Size** | Change the default Tile Size of the NavMesh. To make the bake process parallel and memory efficient, the Scene is divided into tiles for baking. The white lines visible on the NavMesh are tile boundaries. <br/> The default tile size is 256 voxels, which provides a good trade-off between memory use and NavMesh fragmentation. <br/> To change this default tile size, select this checkbox. In the **Tile Size** field, specify the number of voxels you want the tile size to be. <br/> The smaller the tiles, the more fragmented the NavMesh is. This can sometimes cause non-optimal paths. NavMesh carving also operates on tiles. If you have a lot of obstacles in your scene, you can often speed up carving by making the tile size smaller (for example around 64 to 128 voxels). For more information, refer to [Carving](./AboutObstacles.md#carving). <br/> If you plan to bake the NavMesh at runtime, use a smaller tile size to keep the maximum memory use low.|
| **Tile Size**          | Specify the desired Tile Size in voxels. This property is only available if you select the **Override Tile Size** option. |
| **Minimum Region Area**| Remove small regions that are disconnected from the larger NavMesh. The process that builds the NavMesh doesn't retain the stretches of the mesh that have a surface size smaller than the specified value. <br/> **Note**: Some areas might not get removed despite the **Minimum Region Area** parameter. The NavMesh is built in parallel as a grid of tiles. If an area straddles a tile boundary, the area isn't removed. The reason for this is that the area pruning step takes place at a stage in the build process when the surrounding tiles aren't accessible. |
| **Build Height Mesh** | Generate additional data that specifies the height of the surface at each point on the NavMesh. Select this option to generate HeightMesh data. Clear this option if you do not want to generate HeightMesh data. For more information, refer to [**Build a HeightMesh for Accurate Character Placement**](./HeightMesh.md). |
