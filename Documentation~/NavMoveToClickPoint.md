# Move an Agent to a Position Clicked by the Mouse

This script lets you choose the destination point on the [**NavMesh**][1] by clicking the mouse on the objectâ€™s surface. The position of the click is determined by a _raycast_, rather like pointing a laser beam at the object to see where it hits (see the page [Rays from the Camera][2] for a full description of this technique). Since the [GetComponent][3] function is fairly slow to execute, the script stores its result in a variable during the _Start_ function rather than call it repeatedly in _Update_.

``` C#
    // MoveToClickPoint.cs
    using UnityEngine;
    using UnityEngine.AI;
    
    public class MoveToClickPoint : MonoBehaviour {
        NavMeshAgent agent;
        
        void Start() {
            agent = GetComponent<NavMeshAgent>();
        }
        
        void Update() {
            if (Input.GetMouseButtonDown(0)) {
                RaycastHit hit;
                
                if (Physics.Raycast(Camera.main.ScreenPointToRay(Input.mousePosition), out hit, 100)) {
                    agent.destination = hit.point;
                }
            }
        }
    }
```
