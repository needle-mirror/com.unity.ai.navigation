# NavMesh Modifier Volume component reference

Use the NavMesh Modifier Volume component to change the area type of any NavMeshes within a defined region. The available properties allow you to define the affected region and specify the change in area type that you want. However, the modifier volume only affects the NavMeshes that are being newly built for the selected agent types. It has no effect on NavMeshes that already exist in the scene or in that volume and no effect on NavMeshes that get built for unaffected agent types. 

You need to add the NavMesh Modifier Volume component to a GameObject. Though you can add the NavMesh Modifier Volume component to any GameObject in your scene, you typically add it to the GameObject that's associated with the NavMesh you want to affect. 

To add the NavMesh Modifier Volume component to a GameObject, do the following:
1. Select the GameObject you want to use.
1. In the Inspector, select **Add Component** &gt; **Navigation** &gt; **NavMesh Modifier Volume**. <br/> The NavMesh Modifier Volume component is displayed in the Inspector window.

To change the area type of an entire GameObject, use the [NavMesh Modifier](NavMeshModifier.md) component instead.

NavMesh Modifier Volume is useful when you need to assign an area type to part of your NavMesh that might not be represented as separate geometry. For example, you can use NavMesh Modifier Volume to make part of your NavMesh non-walkable or more difficult to cross.
The NavMesh Modifier Volume always assigns its area type when it overlaps with [NavMesh Modifier](NavMeshModifier.md) objects, even if the area type of the volume has a lower index. When multiple volumes intersect, the area type with the highest index value out of all of them takes precedence. The exception to these rules is that the built-in Not Walkable area type assigned to any of the overlapping components is always the most important.

The NavMesh Modifier Volume affects the NavMesh generation process. As a result, the NavMesh is updated to reflect any changes to NavMesh Modifier Volumes.

The following table describes the properties available in the NavMesh Modifier Volume component.
